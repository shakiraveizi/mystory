            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the summer of 2024, I returned to my hometown of Sarandë, Albania, for my summer vacation. The sun-kissed beaches, crystal-clear waters, and my family awaited me. But this summer was extra special, as it marked the beginning of a new chapter in my life with the opening of my restaurant, Rozmarinë.</p>

    <h2>Beach Adventures</h2>
    <p>As soon as the weather started to warm up me and my friends headed to Ksamil. Ksamil is a small town 15 minutes away by car from Saranda and it has the most stunning beaches. It has also become very popluar these years, as tourism in Albania has increased significantly. And that's why the beggining of summer was the best time to. We had a picnic and a fun beach day and I felt so grateful that my home is so magical. It was the start of many more adventures. For that summer <br>
    Ksamil was our top destination when it came to beaches. Me and my friends would go there whenever we wanted to go to the beach. From swimming, sunbathing, paddle boarding, jet skiing and to eating delicious seafood, we did it all. Somedays we were so tired that we would go to the beach, drink coffee, play cards all day and then head back home.</p>

            <h2>Family&Friends</h2>
            <p>Family gatherings in Sarandë are always filled with love, laughter, and, of course, delicious food. We would eat lunch everyday together and catch up about all the new projects we were planning. Also my friends were an undivided part of my day as I would always meet and spend time with them. Every night we would go out for walks, cocktails and dancing.
          <p>However, it wasn't just fun and games. My family had decided that we would open a restaurant that summer and it was a lot of work. Apart from all the fun, the place was under construction and the tourism season had started. We needed to work quickly and do everything in record time. We managed to finish everything and the restaurant finally opened its doors on July 28th. <br>
        All the hard work was worth it when we saw our idea come to life. I have always had a passion for cooking and my mum is also a great cook. At that point I was just filled with excitment and motivation to work.  </p>

    <h2>The Grand Opening</h2>
    <p>The day of the grand openeing came and we threw a great party. It took a lot of effort that we had to put in to get everything ready on time. We invited all of our friends and family and served some of the best food I had ever eaten, prepared by our amazing chef. Me and my girlfriends were running up and down to make sure everything was perfect for the guests. We had an amazing evening with music, laughter and new memories to cherish. All the smells of the delicous melas now remind me of home and excatly those moments when we first opened. <br>
   Owning a family business is not for the faint-hearted, but the fear only gave us the desire to push through, so that we could bring the best version of our business. In our restaurant we would serve mediterranean food made only with fresh local ingridients, so I was constantly helping out with re-stocking, and cooking. It was tiring, but a lot of fun as my friends also helped me a lot to with chores that needed to be done. It was the best summer job I could have ever asked for.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>This summer in Saranda was one of the most fulfilling times of my life. From enjoying the simple pleasures to achieving my lifelong dream of opening a restaurant. Rozmarinë is more than a restaurant—it’s a place where people can come together to create their own stories and memories and I am so dedicated to bringing out the best of it. </p>
            <p>I know that it will not be an easy journey as we just opened and we still got a long way to go and to learn, however I will always help my family and I know that we will succsed our expectations. This year I will continue to work there and I have lots of new ideas for our place, that I can't wait to try out. We will have a new menu with a traditional twist to it, as well as an aditional breakfast and cocktails menu. We will expand our social media presence and create new, authentic content that I can't wait to share. Saranda will always hold a special place in my heart, and I am eager to see what the future holds for Rozmarinë and the journey ahead.</p>
