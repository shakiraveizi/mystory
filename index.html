            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the summer of 2024, I returned to my hometown of Sarandë, Albania, for my summer vacation. The sun-kissed beaches, crystal-clear waters, and my family awaited me. But this summer was extra special, as it marked the beginning of a new chapter in my life with the opening of my restaurant, Rozmarinë.</p>

            <h2>Beach Adventures</h2>
            <p>The day I was going to travel from Chicago to my final destination Albania came and I could not wait to back home. I was excited yet a bit stressed about the events that were comming up. Every morning, the call of the Ionian Sea drew me to the beaches of Sarandë. My friends and I spent hours sunbathing, swimming and laughing under sun. The evenings were magical, with mesmerizing sunsets painting the sky in hues of orange and pink. We even rented a small boat to explore the hidden coves around Ksamil, a nearby village famous for its untouched beauty. <br>
            However it was not just all fun because I had to help building my family upcoming business.</p>

                <li>Snorkeling among fish</li>
                <li>Picnic on the secluded beach of Pulebardha</li>
                <li>Unforgettable sunsets with friends</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Family&Friends</h2>
            <p>Family gatherings in Sarandë are always filled with love, laughter, and, of course, delicious food. We would eat lunch everyday together and catch up about all the new projects we were planning. Also my friends were an undivided part of my day as I would always meet and spend time with them.
          <p>Every night we would go out for walks, cocktails and dancing. </p>

            <h2>The Grand Opening</h2>
            <p>The highlight of my summer was the grand opening of my restaurant, Rozmarinë, which means "rosemary" in English. Located in the centre of Sarandë, Rozmarinë aims to bring a wonderful taste of the mediterreanean cuisine made only with fresh local ingridients. Months of planning and hard work culminated in this unforgettable day. With the help of everyone we managed to finish everything and operate in record time. It was
                super stressful to finish everything on time but fourtunately we managed at the end. </p>
         <p>July marked the grand opening of the restaurant. Guests gathered to taste dishes made with fresh ingredients by our amazing chef and also to enjoy a fun party. We ate good food, cought up with our friends, took pictures and listened to good music.Seeing everyone enjoy the food and ambiance made me feel incredibly proud as me and my family had made it. Rozmarinë was officially open, and it was a dream come true. But the hardest part had just started. <br>
            Now it was time to finally run the restaurant and get ready to face the next challenges.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>This summer in Saranda was one of the most fulfilling times of my life. From enjoying the simple pleasures to achieving my lifelong dream of opening a restaurant. Rozmarinë is more than a restaurant—it’s a place where people can come together to create their own stories and memories.</p>
            <p>I know that it will not be an easy journey as we just opened and we still got a long way to go and to learn, however I will always help my family and I know that we will succsed our expectations. Saranda will always hold a special place in my heart, and I can’t wait to see what the future holds for Rozmarinë and the journey ahead.</p>
